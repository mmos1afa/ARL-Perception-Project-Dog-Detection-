## 2. Project Overview

This project trains and evaluates a single-class dog detector using Ultralytics YOLO11. The notebook performs the complete workflow:

1. Collect and validate image-label pairs.
2. Create deterministic, leakage-free train, validation, and test splits.
3. Generate the YOLO dataset configuration.
4. Train YOLO11n and YOLO11s.
5. Evaluate both models on the reserved test set.
6. Benchmark latency and throughput.
7. Run inference on eight external images.
8. Display training plots, the confusion matrix, and prediction images inline.

The implementation is in [`pipeline.ipynb`](pipeline.ipynb).

## 3. Dataset Attribution and Acquisition

- **Source:** Roboflow Universe, single-class dog dataset (`yolo-dog`)
- **Format:** Standard YOLO text labels:

  ```text
  <class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
  ```

- **Coordinate range:** Normalized to `[0.0, 1.0]`
- **License/use:** Educational and non-commercial research use

## 4. Dataset Volume and Class Distribution

- **Total usable RGB images:** 408
- **Total ground-truth instances:** 467 bounding boxes
- **Classes:** 1 (`dog`, class ID 0)
- **Mean instance density:** approximately 1.14 instances per image

The dataset includes isolated portraits, different breeds, multi-dog scenes, and images with significant background clutter.

## 5. Dataset Organization and Splitting

The notebook uses `random.Random(seed=42)` to shuffle the validated image-label pairs before copying them into the final dataset. The split is deterministic and is performed before training augmentations.

| Split | Images | Percentage | Bounding boxes | Purpose | Leakage status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| Train | 285 | 69.85% | 332 | Weight optimization and feature learning | Zero overlap |
| Validation | 81 | 19.85% | 85 | Hyperparameter monitoring and checkpoint selection | Zero overlap |
| Test (reserved) | 42 | 10.30% | 50 | Final unbiased benchmark | Zero overlap |
| **Total** | **408** | **100.00%** | **467** | Complete audited dataset | Verified |

The audit checks:

- No filename overlap between train, validation, and test.
- Every image has a matching label file.
- Every label row has class ID `0` and five YOLO fields.
- All normalized coordinate values are within the accepted range.

The split output is organized as:

```text
dataset/
  train/
    images/
    labels/
  valid/
    images/
    labels/
  test/
    images/
    labels/
```

## 6. Dataset Configuration

The notebook writes `configs/data.yaml`. The portable equivalent is:

```yaml
path: ../dataset
train: train/images
val: valid/images
test: test/images

nc: 1
names: ['dog']
```

For local execution, the notebook currently writes an absolute Windows path for `path` so Ultralytics can resolve the dataset reliably.

## 7. Model Architecture and Selection

### YOLO11n baseline

YOLO11n is the selected deployment model because the dataset contains only 285 training images. A larger model can memorize coat colors, backgrounds, and other dataset-specific details. The compact YOLO11n architecture provides suitable capacity while reducing overfitting risk.

The YOLO11 family includes:

- C3k2 blocks for efficient feature extraction.
- C2PSA attention for improved spatial context.
- An anchor-free detection head.
- Distribution Focal Loss for continuous bounding-box localization.
- Feature pyramid processing for targets at different scales.

### YOLO11s bonus variant

YOLO11s is trained as a comparison model. It has more parameters and higher compute cost, but the results show that the smaller YOLO11n model is better suited to this dataset and deployment target.

## 8. Training Environment and Hyperparameters

### Hardware and software

- **Computer:** Lenovo LOQ 15
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU, 6144 MiB VRAM
- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-12450HX, 8 cores / 12 threads
- **RAM:** 16 GB DDR5
- **Operating system:** Windows 11
- **Python:** 3.13.5
- **PyTorch:** 2.11.0+cu128
- **CUDA:** 12.8
- **Ultralytics:** 8.4.171
- **Torchvision:** 0.26.0+cu128

### Training settings

| Hyperparameter | YOLO11n | YOLO11s | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Input resolution | 640 x 640 | 640 x 640 | Balanced for small and large dogs |
| Batch size | 16 | 8 | YOLO11s uses 8 for 6 GB VRAM headroom |
| Epochs | 50 | 50 | Full convergence run |
| Optimizer | AdamW | AdamW | Automatic Ultralytics selection |
| Base learning rate | 0.002 | 0.002 | Selected by the optimizer configuration |
| Warmup | 3 epochs | 3 epochs | Warmup period |
| Box loss weight | 7.5 | 7.5 | Strong localization emphasis |
| Classification loss weight | 0.5 | 0.5 | Single-class classification |
| DFL loss weight | 1.5 | 1.5 | Bounding-box distribution refinement |
| Mosaic | 1.0 | 1.0 | Disabled during the final 10 epochs |
| Horizontal flip | 0.5 | 0.5 | Data augmentation |
| DataLoader workers | 0 | 0 | Prevents Windows/Jupyter multiprocessing deadlocks |
| Device | CUDA device 0 | CUDA device 0 | RTX 3050 |

The notebook uses `workers=0` because PyTorch uses process spawning on Windows. Nonzero DataLoader workers can deadlock inside an interactive Jupyter kernel.

## 9. Running the Notebook

Install the main dependency in the selected notebook kernel:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

For CUDA execution, PyTorch and torchvision must use compatible CUDA wheels. The verified environment uses:

```text
torch==2.11.0+cu128
torchvision==0.26.0+cu128
```

Run the notebook cells in order:

1. Prepare and audit the dataset.
2. Train both models.
3. Evaluate the reserved test set.
4. Run latency benchmarking and comparison.
5. Run unseen-image inference.
6. Display the generated plots and predictions.

At least five images must be present in `unseen_test_images/`. This project uses eight external images.

## 10. Model Checkpoints

The completed training run currently stores checkpoints in the legacy Ultralytics directory layout:

```text
runs/detect/runs/yolo11n/weights/best.pt
runs/detect/runs/yolo11s/weights/best.pt
```

The notebook's checkpoint resolver supports these paths and the corrected future layout:

```text
runs/yolo11n/weights/best.pt
runs/yolo11s/weights/best.pt
```

The source pretrained weights are also present at the project root:

```text
yolo11n.pt
yolo11s.pt
```

## 11. Quantitative Evaluation

Evaluation was performed strictly on the reserved test split of 42 images containing 50 ground-truth instances.

| Metric | YOLO11n baseline | YOLO11s bonus | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Precision | 0.9763 (97.6%) | 0.9591 (95.9%) | +1.72% YOLO11n |
| Recall | 1.0000 (100.0%) | 0.9800 (98.0%) | +2.00% YOLO11n |
| F1 score | 0.9880 (98.8%) | 0.9694 (96.9%) | +1.86% YOLO11n |
| mAP@50 | 0.9946 (99.5%) | 0.9792 (97.9%) | +1.54% YOLO11n |
| mAP@50-95 | 0.8012 (80.1%) | 0.7305 (73.1%) | +7.07% YOLO11n |

The final verified test evaluation produced approximately:

- YOLO11n: precision 0.9763, recall 1.0000, mAP@50 0.9946, mAP@50-95 0.8012
- YOLO11s: precision 0.9591, recall 0.9800, mAP@50 0.9792, mAP@50-95 0.7305

## 12. Real-World Stress Testing

The YOLO11n model was tested on eight external images not used during training or validation.

| Scenario | Observation | Result | Confidence / assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backlit silhouette | Dog against a sunset sky | Detected | 0.83; structural contours remained usable |
| Close-up portrait | Cropped face with no visible body | Detected | 0.91; snout and ear geometry activated features |
| Foliage occlusion | Dog partly hidden in tall grass | Detected | 0.75; localization survived foreground clutter |
| Low ambient light | Dim room and dark shadows | Detected | 0.71; detection remained stable in low contrast |
| Distant target | Dog occupied less than 2% of the frame | Detected | 0.43; small-object features remained active |
| Multi-dog pack | Three dogs interacting | Partial / grouped | 0.91 and 0.74; NMS merged two overlapping dogs |
| Extreme occlusion | Dog hidden under a couch | Missed | False negative; more than 80% occlusion and shadow |
| Hard negative | Orange kitten portrait | False positive | 0.82 and 0.59; single-class training generalized to a quadruped |

Prediction images are saved to:

```text
runs/unseen_eval/predictions/
```

## 13. Model Size and Efficiency Study

| Model | Parameters | GFLOPs | Checkpoint size | Latency | Throughput | mAP@50-95 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| YOLO11n | 2,582,347 | 6.4 | 5.22 MB | 13.12 ms | 76.21 FPS | 0.8012 |
| YOLO11s | 9,413,187 | 21.4 | 18.27 MB | 14.77 ms | 67.69 FPS | 0.7305 |

### Deployment verdict

YOLO11n is the recommended deployment model. With a 5.22 MB checkpoint, 6.4 GFLOPs, and more than 75 FPS in the benchmark, it is appropriate for real-time edge inference, robotics platforms, embedded Jetson devices, and streaming applications.

YOLO11s has approximately 3.6 times as many parameters but did not improve results on this moderate-sized dataset. The YOLO11n result suggests that the smaller model provides useful structural regularization for this task.

## 14. Engineering Challenges and Solutions

### Windows multiprocessing deadlock

**Issue:** PyTorch DataLoader workers use process spawning on Windows. In a Jupyter kernel, nonzero worker counts can hang on inter-process communication locks.

**Solution:** Set `workers=0` and explicitly select CUDA device 0.

### Nested output paths

**Issue:** Relative project paths can be interpreted relative to Ultralytics' configured detection directory.

**Solution:** Convert the training project directory to an absolute path before calling `model.train`.

### Overlapping dogs

**Issue:** Dogs playing close together can be merged into one bounding box by non-maximum suppression.

**Potential solution:** Tune the NMS IoU threshold, for example from 0.45 toward 0.35, and review the effect on grouped scenes.

### Cross-species false positives

**Issue:** A single-class dog detector can classify visually similar quadrupeds, such as cats, as dogs.

**Potential solution:** Add 10-15% empty-background images containing non-target animals, using empty YOLO label files, and retrain.
